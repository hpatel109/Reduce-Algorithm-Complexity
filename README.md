# Reduce-Algorithm-Complexity

Implemented

(a) Prim’s algorithm 
(b) Kruskal’s algorithm
(c) Boruvka’s algorithm
in java. The program took as input a graph represented as an adjacency list in the format:
< vertex v0 > ((< vertex v1 >,< weight of edge(v0,v1) >),···),
< vertex v1 > ((< vertex v2 >,< weight of edge(v1,v2) >),···), ···
and output an MST in the same format.
